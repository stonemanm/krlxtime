# krlxtime

Translates the current time into the Carleton schedule. Designed for use with Geektool to make my desktop more functional (and honestly, cooler).

**Version:** 1.0.0

## Usage

Compile the java files, then open a shell script in GeekTool and enter the following...

'''bash
java -cp /path/to/krlxtime krlxtime -n
'''

...where n is replaced with 0, 1, or 2.
